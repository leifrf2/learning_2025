This is a test driven coding question. Interviewers ask to define an interface for resumable iterators. For eg:

class IteratorInterface:
    def __init__(self):
    def __iter__(self):
    def __next__(self):
    def get_state(self):
    def set_state(self, state):
Part A: Write a test class to test set_state and get_state functionality of this iterator interface. For every step of iteration, capture the state and resume iterator using the captured state and validate the output. A sample test case would look something like below:

def test_iterator(my_iter):
states = []
while my_iter.hasNext(): # Needs to handle when my_iter exhuasted
	states.append(my_iter.get_state())
	for state in states:
		test_iter = my_iter.set_state(state)
		elements = all elements from test_iter to the end
		assert elements == expected_elements
Part B: Implement IteratorInterface functions : next , get_state and set_state . This shouldnâ€™t take too long to implement. If using a typed language, get yourself familiar with Generics as one will have to implement a generics interface.

Part C: Given an implementation of IteratorInterface to read from a single Json file (lets call it JsonFileIterator which returns the next token in a single Json file. Implement another iterator (lets call it MultipleJsonFileIterator ) which implements an iterator over a set of files using SingleJsonFileIterator . These iterators should support resumable capabilities so pay special attention to how set_state and get_state functions get implemented. We will run the same tests written in Part A to test MultipleJsonFileIterator
