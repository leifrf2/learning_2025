"""
The main part of the interview involves solving a coding problem.
You're given a class called Cell and are asked to create a new method.
This method should update a cell's value and also update other cells that depend on it,
similar to how Excel works. 
Once you're done with the coding part, they might ask about your approach and why you made certain choices.
You can also ask them questions.
