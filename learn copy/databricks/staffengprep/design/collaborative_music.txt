Design a collaborative music playlist that can be shared among multiple clients.
Each client can update the playlist, subscribe to changes and use the playlist to list and listen to individual songs.

How to ensure a good user experience while ensuring performance?
For example: If the customer changes the order of music (user changes music 1 to music 2),
how should the update event be designed?
If a lock is to be added, how can it be added with the least impact on user experience?
If the user changes the playlist on the client and the server sends the update back, 
what should the client do to have a better user experience?
