Process stock trading requests sent by customers.
The system needs to connect to the API provided by the broker to 
buy or sell a certain number of stocks of a company before the deadline.

If the transaction is not successful after the deadline, the transaction needs to be canceled. 
(We don’t need to worry about whether the transaction is successful or not.
Calling the broker interface will tell us the status.)

For example, the client can send the following request:

- BUY BABA 30 “2023-11-01 15:00:00”
- SELL AMZN 10 “2023-11-01 12:00:00”
- The broker provides 3 interfaces:
- A GET interface for obtaining the order transaction status
- A POST interface for creating a stock ‍‌‌‌‌‍‍‌‌‌‌‍‌‌‌‌‌‍‌‌‌‌‍‍ trading order
- A DELETE interface for canceling a transaction
